# Pokemon Battle Simulator

The following code is meant to replicate a battle from the Pokemon games.

As of now, I have created a tutorial system for how the game should work. In this tutorial, players select a starter Pokemon and battle with their rival. Players will choose a move from their Pokemon's move list to damage their opponent's Pokemon. The trainer that defeats the other trainer's Pokemon wins.
